- [ ] Fix 500 error on signup by adding validation for unique username and handling IntegrityError. I have applied the fix and added tests. Please run the tests to verify the fix.
- [ ] To run the tests, navigate to the `backend` directory and run the command `python manage.py test accounts`.
- [ ] Modify Signup.jsx to store email in localStorage after successful signup
- [ ] Modify EmailVerification.jsx to retrieve email from localStorage and send both email and otp in the request
- [ ] Rename 'code' to 'otp' in EmailVerification.jsx to match backend serializer
- [ ] Set DEBUG=False in production environment variables
- [ ] Ensure migrations are run on deployment (e.g., set build command on Render: python manage.py migrate)
- [ ] Set SECRET_KEY environment variable in production
